												<h4>Details</h4>
												<p>
													I usually start feeding the animals in the am at like 5:00 - 7:00 AM... so if you are staying here, they will start trying to wake you up around that time...sorry :/
													<b>Jams is picky and may not eat all (most) food</b> Let Bella have whatever he doesn't want to eat.
													<b>Stew</b> I have some stew for the dogs in the fridge. The dogs are used to eating warm food, so they might like it better if its microwaved for a few seconds... but its stew that I made just for them so they are spoiled already and serving it cold is fine if you don't want to bother.
													When you feed the dogs, lock Pajama in his crate. (Bella sometimes tries to eat his food when he is not closed in).
													<b>The dogs water bowl</b> in the kitchen needs to be refilled 1-2 times per day. <b>Let the dogs out into the yard</b> for about 10 minutes after you have finished feeding.
													NOTE- if you stay in the yard with them the entire time, they probably will not poop outside, but will later shit in the hallway in the house. So for at least a few minutes they need to be alone out there.

												<p>

													CLOSE THE "ZOMBIE CAGE" (wrought iron gate) WHEN YOU GO TO FEED THE GOATS. The dogs can't fit between the bars, so they won't be able to attack the goats.
													The goats usually want to go in the main part of the backyard as soon as you open the gate. Feel free to let them in the yard... but some days they may stay on you like flies on shit though, so if that is the case just kind of shimmy in to feed the chickens however you have to without letting goats in or chickens out.
													If the goats get in there its not a huge deal, you can probably lure them out with food, but its best if they do not go in the chicken coop (esp totes. He's a fat little love love these days but he still wants to climb all over the coop shelves.)
													Often opening the gate is enough to get them to come back in their coral, but you may need to lure them with treats, or physically push them. <b>Getting them back into the barnyard</b> Usually they will be ready to go back in when they see you put food in their bowl... but if they will not come back in, there should be a leash hanging on the wall by our sun room, collar Totes (black and white) and puuuullll him back into the barnyard. McGoats hates to be alone and will come along eventually.

There is a home depot bucket under the goats' picnic table that I empty the dustpan into.
														This is optional. If you are grossed out its fine to just leave it and I'll take care of it when I'm home. There will probably be 2-4 eggs in one of their bedded sections in the barn. Please collect eggs. Feel free to eat as many eggs as you like... there are extra egg cartons in the cabinet to the left of the kitchen sink if there is no more room in the carton in the fridge to put the eggs.
														<b>Outdoor Water</b> Bucket is in the outdoor 'coop' and you can shove a container of ice through the hole in the fence. (1 or 2 is fine) <b>if the water looks nasty or low</b>, you should be able to just turn on the hose spiggot in the back yard to fill the bucket if its low and the water looks clean --if the water is murkey, turn on the spiggot then go around behind the she-shack into the coop and dump out water, spray with hose to get algae off and put hose in bucket to fill.
														<b class="hidden">Misting fan</b> I have been leaving the fan on 2-3 speed all the time. MIST FUNCTIONALITY NOT WORKING ATM... I usually only turn on the mister if its going to be more than 110 (see pic below for turning on).

														<br>
														light is on from about 6:00AM until 1:00AM. No maintenance needed in here, but it gets too hot if the door is all the way closed so I usually leave it propped open quite a bit with a mop propped in teh doorway and the pocked door closed.
														<br>
														<h4>Main Plant Room</h4>
														<br>
														<b>Hydro Plants</b>
														<br>
														The light is on from 6:15AM - 7:15PM. Around 6:15PM the light changes to red only, so you should only be in there between 6:15AM - 6:15PM. I will top of h2o and nutrients in buckets before we leave, so on the second or third day that you are there, you will probably need to add about 1-2 gal of nutrient water (I will have some premixed) add 1 full gal jug per bucket
														<br>
														<b>Succulents</b>
														<br>
														Please water succulents daily! I have never been able to find a spray bottle that doesn't turn into a total piece of shit within a month, so I have switched to using spray bottles capped with one of my goat nipples as a watering device and I find that to work just great... The nipple was a little hard to get on the bottle the first time, but I've either stretched it out or gotten better at it ( tldr - i have no advice for getting the nipple on the bottle)... but once its on there, just dribble a bit of water onto every littel succulent sprout in my "tapstery", squirt some into each of the pots by the door and also into the coffee plant (under the succulent tapestery table) and there is also a venus fly trap amongst the buckets... it should always have at least 1/4 " of h2o in its tray.
														<br>
														<h4>Important note</h4>
														The flower clusters are getting pretty thick, so "bud rot" becomes a concern. To keep the humidity below 60%, you should leave teh door open from the plant room to our bedroom and close our bedroom door to keep the dogs out.
