												<p>
													I usually start feeding the animals in the am at like 5:00 - 6:00 AM... so if you are staying here, they will start trying to wak you up around that time.
													<b>Chicken + Rice</b> = microwave 1 cup (dry) instant rice + about 1.5 cup water + 2 tbsp butter for 5 min. When cooked add 2-3 handfulls of frozen chicken and mix together. Let cool about 2-3 min.
													When you feed the dogs, lock Pajama in his crate and close the laundry room (pocket door) behind you. Bella will eventually get out, but it will make it easier for you to get into the yard without being bothered.
													Also close the "Zombie cage" behind you. The goats can fit in between the bars, but the dogs can't, so it will allow the goats to escape to a safe place if needed.
													The dogs water bowl in the kitchen needs to be refilled 1-2 times per day. Let the dogs out into the yard for about 10 minutes after you have finished feeding the goats.
													NOTE- if you stay in the yard with them the entire time, they probably will not poop outside, but will later shit in the hallway in the house. So for at least a few minutes they need to be alone out there.
													If you would like to play with Luke, he needs to be in the house alone with you. Bella gets very confrontational and jealous if you pay too much attention to Luke when she is around.

												<p>
													The goats are always eager to be in the 'main yard', so getting them out there only requires you to open the gate. Getting them back in the 'barn yard' may be more difficult.
													Often opening the gate is enough, but you may need to lure them with treats, phsyically push them or pick them up and carry them back in... if they go in and leave again right away,
													carrying them is pretty much the only way to get them back in.

														This is optional. If you are grossed out its fine to just leave it and I'll take care of it when I'm home. The will probably be 1-2 eggs in one of their bedded sections in the barn. Please collect eggs. Feel free to eat as many eggs as you like... there are extra egg cartons in the cabinet to the left of the kitchen sink if there is no more roon in the carton in the fridge to put the eggs.

													Charlotte, my oldest chicken often runs out of the coop when you first open it. I usually let her roam around in the barnyard while I do the barnyard feeding and either pick her up and put her back in the coop or lure her in with meal worms.

													<b>Car Key</b> will be on the kitchen counter. Garage door opener is on the visor on the drivers side of car. Please close garage door when you're coming and going... there are theiving ass motherfuckers that have been known to come around.
													We don't typically lock the house, but feel free to do so if you like. House keys are all in the locks (need key to open from inside or outside).
													Pajama eats everything, so unless you will be gone for more than 12 hours, its recommended to <b>leave PJ in his crate when you are gone</b>. Bella will eat cardboard, paper, wrappers etc if she can. She loves beer and will probably eat weed, so keep that stuff somewhere the dogs cant get to it.
													Feel free to eat and drink anything we have in the kitchen. <b>EAT EGGS and CAKE PLEASE!</b>. There are pots and pans in the cabinet on teh kitchen island and silverware in the island drawers.
													Our dishwasher is pretty legit so you don't need to do too much preswashing before putting dishes in there.
													<b>If the outside plants look like the heat is getting to them, please manually set off the drip system. (see pic)</b>
													I have washed the sheets and towels in the guest bedroom.  If you
													want to wash anything feel free to use our washer and drier. There is soap in the drawer under the washer or you can use the 'eco nuts'. Drier sheets are in the cabinet above the washer.
													See pics for info on wifi and watching TV. If you have any questions about anything text me and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. :)
