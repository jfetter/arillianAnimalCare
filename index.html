												<p>
													I usually start feeding the animals in the am at like 5:00 - 7:00 AM... so if you are staying here, they will start trying to wake you up around that time...sorry :/
													<b>Jams is picky and may not eat all (most) food</b> Let Bella have whatever he doesn't want to eat.
													<b>Hot Dogs </b>  Hot dogs are in the fridge
													When you feed the dogs, lock Pajama, Xena and Hughey in crates. (Bella sometimes tries to eat others foods when not closed in).
													<b>The dogs water bowl</b> in the kitchen needs to be refilled 1-2 times per day. <b>Let the dogs out into the yard</b> for about 10 minutes after you have finished feeding.
													NOTE- if you stay in the yard with them the entire time, they probably will not poop outside, but will later shit in the hallway in the house. So for at least a few minutes they need to be alone out there.

													CLOSE THE "ZOMBIE CAGE" (wrought iron gate) WHEN YOU GO TO FEED THE GOATS. The dogs can't fit between the bars, so they won't be able to attack the goats.
													The goats usually want to go in the main part of the backyard as soon as you open the gate. Feel free to let them in the yard... but some days they may stay on you like flies on shit though, so if that is the case just kind of shimmy in to feed the chickens however you have to without letting goats in or chickens out.
													If the goats get in there its not a huge deal, you can probably lure them out with food, but its best if they do not go in the chicken coop (esp totes. He's a fat little love love these days but he still wants to climb all over the coop shelves.)
													Often opening the gate is enough to get them to come back in their coral, but you may need to lure them with treats, or physically push them. <b>Getting them back into the barnyard</b> Usually they will be ready to go back in when they see you put food in their bowl... but if they will not come back in, there should be a leash hanging on the wall by our sun room, collar Totes (black and white) and puuuullll him back into the barnyard. McGoats hates to be alone and will come along eventually.

														All of the dogs are plant-eating assholes, so watch out for them
														<br>
														<b>Laundry Room Pantry</b>
														<br>
														<img src="./assets/zPantryBloom.jpg" style="height: 300px;">
														<br>
														light is on from about 4:00AM until 5:00PM. No maintenance needed in here, but it gets too hot if the door is all the way closed so I usually leave it open and the pocked door closed with a chair or something in front of it.
														<br>
														The plant(s) in the "current culture" water flow system should not need nutrients or anything... the blooming plant sort of rebounded after it got root rot, so I'm probably goign to let it go to 8 weeks, but text me if something suddenly looks alarmingly off with it.
														<br>
														The "Sarcophagus" plant in the bucket in the center of the room will be in its second week of bloom, so it should be growing like crazy. Check its bucket and if its below the bottom of the basket in there, add nutrient water until water level is back to the bottom of the basket(from fridge --see image below)
														<br>
														<img src="./assets/zbubbler.jpg" style="height: 300px;">
														<br>
														<h4>Bedroom Plant Room</h4>
														<img src="./assets/zbedroomGrow.jpg" style="height: 300px;">

														<br>
														The cannabis should be fine on nutrients and water, but please check that the bubblers haven't vibrated their hose loose and disconnected the air supply. (That keeps happening ...I think the tubing I last bought is slightly too small, so if something does disconnect do you best to wrangle it back over the aerator or pressure valve as best you can ).
														<br>
														<img src="./assets/plantNutrients.jpg" style="height: 300px;">
														<br>
														 The tomato and bell pepper plants will probably need water at least once or twice while you are caregiving. I will leave nutrient water in the fridge. Check them daily and add water as needed to keep the bucket full up to just below the bottom of their grownbasket.
														<br>

														<br>
														<b>Water Fruit Trees With Hose</b>
														<br>
														Please water trees every other day starting the day after we leave (Saturday). Just turn the hose on (see pic) for a couple minutes under the pomegranite bush, grapefruit tree, orange tree and potted olive tree. -- watch out for the thorny rose bush when you walk past the raised brick bed.
