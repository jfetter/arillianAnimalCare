                        My boyfriend and I Live in Mesa, AZ.
                        His name is Arthur and my name is Jillian.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Arthur + Jillian = Arillian.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I grow lots of things in our yard, so I often refer to our house as Arillian Farm.

                        Arthur is an electrical engineer. He likes to “work on things” –especially cars and audio and lighting things especially audio and lighting for cars.

                        Sometimes we work on projects around our house together: like the shade sail we made for our goats, or the little fishpond I wanted to build, so I could raise fish for my chickens and give them somewhere to soak their feet in the summer.
                        We’ve also had a few occasions to learn that Arthur is great at welding AC fans, cutting and installing baseboards and t&g ceiling boards, and he is my handy man, hottie, hero.

                        I used to be a software developer, but now I’m a (self-labeled) micro-farmer, which is to say, I have a bunch of raised garden beds and chickens in my backyard along with a couple (male) goats  and several dogs.
                        My income comes mainly from rent for a home that I purchased with inheritance money and the additional house that I used software money to add behind it.

                        I like to write. I try to write humorous and/or thought invoking things. I wrote a couple books (because every decade or so all these thoughts and words seem to just ooze out of my fingertips and onto my keyboard). Every once in a while I have funny thoughts and story ideas that I think would make a good comic. Sometimes I also jot down jokes or songs that I think would be cool if I ever become a braver or more attention seeking person and want to have some type of career where I encourage people to look and/or listen to me when I say stuff.
                        I’m a vegetarian, and I’m trying to cook and bake as much as I can –especially from the things that grow seasonally in my yard. I’m going to try to catalog the recipes I use on this site. My boyfriend eats meat, but he has a recipe for a not that tasty, but super healthy smoothie we have four or five mornings a week, I’ll put that on here too.

                    <p>
                        My three goals in building this website are to:
                        One, give myself a place to offload the important bits of thoughts, ideas and memories from my life, so I can look back on them or easily share them with friends and family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two, keep myself busy and keep my mind busy when it’s too hot to putter around in my garden as much as I’d like to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Three, if some stranger wanders upon my page, beg for patronage, so that I can have more money to buy lumber etc to build things and grow things on my lil urban farm, so please feel free to hit up my go fund me.
                    </p>
