                                                        Feel free to eat and drink anything we have in the kitchen. There are pots and pans in the cabinet on the kitchen island and silverware in the island drawers.
                                                        Our dishwasher is pretty legit so you don't need to do too much pre-washing before putting dishes in there.

                                                        I have washed the sheets and towels in the guest bedroom.  If you want to wash anything feel free to use our washer and drier. There is soap in the drawer under the washer. Drier sheets are on top of the drier.
