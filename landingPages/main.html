(3) throw  handfuls of feed to various areas of the chicken coop, so the chickens can spread out to eat. I usually let them roam in the goat corral all day (there is one chicken that occasionally tries to go in the main yard... if she does that just keep the dogs inside and try to shoo her back into the goat area, if she goes in the neighbors yard she will eventually come back, but don't let her stay in our main yard if you see her there) </td>
