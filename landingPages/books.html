            <h3 class="large text-muted">UnFettered puts you behind the eyes of a late bloomer with an active imagination, a craving for romance, and a flawed sense of how to appropriately express herself. After twenty-nine years of playing it safe, Jillian steps away from the comfort of her functional life in search of something more. Her quest to define and obtain fulfillment lead her to explore new living situations, dip a toe in the Internet dating scene, battle blood-sucking insects and confront lifeâ€™s irksome questions: What is a meaningful existence? When is the right time to walk away from love? are cold sores really that bad?</h3>
